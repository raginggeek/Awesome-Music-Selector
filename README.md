Android Development Tutorial Project


This project was the first one I undertook in Android Studio. I had done some Android development in netbeans 
before(building a basic SMS sending application) but found netbeans to be too cumbersome to develop in. I had
some experience with Eclipse but had bad experiences with it in college(which lead me to netbeans for my original
Java projects) so I thought I would try out Android Studio. Android Studio is based on IntelliJ and is in many ways
similar to Eclipse, but tailored specifically for Android development. 

This project was built based on an Android development tutorial I found on kilobolt.com 
(http://www.kilobolt.com/day-4-building-a-music-app---part-1-building-blocks.html) which was a step by step in using
eclipse as a development environment. While the IDE's are similar, there were enough differences to make the project
a light challenge, and I learned the differences between the environments while I learned more about Android
development.
